The Privacy Policy</br>
</br>
We do not collect or store any data about our users. However, we use requests to a third-party API that is required for application functionality. </br>This API stores the IP addresses of users from whom requests come. Here is a quote from TheCatAPI privacy policy:</br>
</br>
"<i><b>IP anonymization</b></br>
</br>
The client IP Address is logged on every request to the API. This is used to prevent malicious use of the API such as denial of service attacks, </br>prevent duplication of Votes, and to provide a rough estimate on the city from which the request originates. After 1 month the IP address is anonymized.</i>"</br>
</br>
The rest of the user data (such as the name of the mobile device, account name, etc.) is used and provided by Google and stored on their servers.
