The Privacy Policy

We do not collect or store any dates about our users. However, we use requests to a third-party API that is required for application functionality. This API stores the IP addresses of users from whom requests come. Here is a quote from TheCatAPI policy:

"IP anonymization

The client IP Address is an API. It is used to prevent the use of such APIs, such as denial of service attacks. After 1 month the IP address is anonymized. "

The rest of the user data (such as the name
mobile device, account name, etc.) is used and provided by Google and stored on their servers.
